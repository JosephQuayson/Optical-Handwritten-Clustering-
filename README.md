## Applying Unsupervised ML Techniques on Clustering 

###  Examining and plotting the optimal number of clusters for Optical recognition of handwritten digits datasets

### Making use of the Dimensionality Reduction Techniques like
1. Principal Components Analysis 
2. t-distributed stochasitic neighbor embedding 

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms Used
1. K-Means 
2. Affinity Propagation 
3. Spectral Clustering 
4. Agglomerative Clustering

### Model Evaluation 
#### The metrics used that is 
1. Silhouette Scores
2. Adjusted Rand Score
3. Adjusted Mutual Info Score

### Conclusion 
1. K-Means outperformed the other models.
